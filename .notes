======
Just do latter when I ask you to:
7. Make the main menu [lvl of need: 8/10] [x]

====
add the infinte mode [x]
====
add the paranoied mode, where the snake never dies but you cant control i
t and it just walks around [random directions] with 13blx of size and each 10sec 
the bg, and snake color changes. [x]

And make so that after you reach 350000+ points you get the access to command 
mode, and there is where you can find the LGBT+++ skin [x]
